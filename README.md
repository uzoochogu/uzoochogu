## Hello <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/hvRJCLFzcasrR4ia7z/giphy.gif" width="25px">, I'm Uzochukwu Ochogu!

### About me
I'm an Engineer. I have a B.Eng in Mechatronics Engineer and I am really interested in Robotics and Automation. I also consider myself a Data Scientist and Machine Learning Engineer but I have dabbled in Application development using C++ so I guess I am a Software Engineer too. As a hobby, I make short films and I am in love with the film making process.


### Tools I use
![CPP Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/C++-blue.svg?style=flat&logo=c%2B%2B) ![Python Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Python-yellow?logo=Python&style=flat)

I primarily use C, C++ and Python. For Cross platform Application development, I use C++ with wxWidgets and have started going through QT since it is popular in industry.
For my Robotics stack, I am familiar with the Arduino C compatible boards, C for PIC 8 bit architecture and ROS.
In my Machine Learning Projects, I use Python and some useful libraries like Numpy, Pandas, Scikit-Learn etc, I will explore some C++ Machine Learning Libraries later.

### Current Industry Interests and Application Areas
1. Embedded systems and Robotics
2. Financial Systems (High Frequency Trading)
3. 3D software and Game Development
3. HPC for Machine Learning models
