## Hello ðŸ‘‹, I'm Uzochukwu Ochogu!

### About me
I'm an Engineer. I have a B.Eng in Mechatronics Engineer and I am really interested in Robotics and Automation. I also consider myself a Data Scientist and Machine Learning Engineer but I have dabbled in Application development using C++ so I guess I am a Software Engineer too. As a hobby, I make short films and I am in love with the film making process.


### Tools I use
I primarily use C, C++ and Python but I have found myself picking up Kotlin and C# depending on the job. 
For Cross platform Application development, I use C++ with wxWidgets and have started going through QT since it is popular in industry.
For my Robotics stack, I am familiar with the Arduino and Arduino C compatible boards, C for PIC 8 bit architecture and ROS.
In my Machine Learning Projects, I use Python and some useful libraries like Numpy, Scikit-Learn etc, I will explore some C++ Libraries later.
